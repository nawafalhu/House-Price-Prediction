# House Price Prediction
## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other factors. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation to develop an accurate price prediction system.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling and encoding
   - Removing outliers

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualizing relationships between features
   - Identifying key factors affecting house prices

3. Model Training
   - Using regression models
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimization

4. Model Evaluation
   - Measuring performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score
## Conclusion 
The House Price Prediction project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning to estimate property prices based on key features. Through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model optimization, the project improves prediction accuracy and identifies the most influential factors affecting house prices.
